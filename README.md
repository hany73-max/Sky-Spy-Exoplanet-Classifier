# 🌌 Sky Spy: AI for Exoplanet Discovery  

> *“When the sky is full of stars… which ones hide new worlds?”*  

Sky Spy is an AI-powered tool built by **Team Exo Explorers** for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**.  
Our mission? To use **machine learning** and **open NASA data** to uncover the hidden planets orbiting distant stars — faster, smarter, and more transparently than ever before.  

---

## ✨ Why Sky Spy?  
- NASA missions like **Kepler** and **TESS** have given us **oceans of data**.  
- Thousands of exoplanets were discovered, but most detections were done **manually** — slow, noisy, and error-prone.  
- With AI, we can:  
  - Detect exoplanets **automatically**  
  - Handle **noisy, imbalanced datasets**  
  - Give **transparent visualizations** that even non-experts can understand

## 🛰️ The Challenge We Tackled  
> **A World Away** — analyzing massive exoplanet datasets to identify new planets using AI/ML.  

Our goal was to train a model on open NASA datasets and make it:  
- Accurate  
- Transparent  
- Interactive

## 🧩 How It Works  

### 1. **Datasets & Preprocessing**  
- Sources: **Kepler** + **TESS**  
- Cleaning: removed noise, filled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns  
- Split into **training/testing** sets  

### 2. **Modelling**  
- Tested **13+ models** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)  
- Winner: **XGBoost Classifier** 🚀  
- Why? It builds multiple decision trees, learns from mistakes, and thrives in **noisy NASA data**  

### 3. **Results**  
- Accuracy: **~90%**  
- Detected > **90% of confirmed exoplanets**  
- Confidence score: **97%**  

### 4. **Visualization**  
Because numbers alone are boring…  
- Scatter plots: planet radius vs star mass  
- Correlation heatmaps: which features matter most  
- Feature importance: why the AI makes decisions  

### 5. **Web Demo**  
- Users input planet data (mass, radius, distance)  
- Output: **Confirmed / Candidate / False Positive**  
- Instant visual explanation for transparency

## 🚀 Future Directions  
- Link with **real-time NASA updates** for continuous learning  
- Add **3D visualizations** of planetary orbits in PowerPoint-style or WebGL  
- Expand classification to stars, moons, or even **rogue planets**  
- Turn Sky Spy into a full **public exploration tool** for space enthusiasts
